Todo:
New Features:
  -[Done] support Braille grade2
  -[Done] handle KSA Tashkeel style in grade 2
  - handle Egyptain tashkeel style in grade 2, put the tashkeel on top of the char.

Better to have:
  - change the way of getting the translation input as a stream instead of one string input cause in the future 
  this service may support translating a book which will have looooooong text :)

Cleaning:
  - use java.util.logging to log important info (ex: unrecognized chars).
  - more documentation.
  - constants for spacing and special chars.
