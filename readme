Online Translation api that translate arabic into Braille.

Todo:
New Features:
  -[Done] support Braille grade2
  -[Done] handle the Tashkeel in grade 2

Better to have:
  - change the way of getting the translation input as a stream instead of one string input cause in the future 
  this service may support translating a book which will have looooooong text :)

Cleaning:
  - use java.util.logging to log important info (ex: unrecognized chars).
